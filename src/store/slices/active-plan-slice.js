/* ========== Learning ========== */
/* No asynchronous operation within reducer function */
// No asynchronous operation within reducer function, like
// http request. Instead, there are two ways to perform http
// reuqest, one is "useEffect()"", another one is "action creator thunk"

/* Mutate the state within reducer function */
// By all means, we should not mutate the state directly within redux functions.
// For this module, we mutate the state directly because that's under the help
// of reduxjs/toolkit, behind the scene, reduxjs/toolkit also doesn't mutate
// the state directly, instead, it creats a new object and return that one
